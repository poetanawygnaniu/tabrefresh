# tabRefresh 1.0.0
Semi automatic Chrome tab refresh carousel, accepts users input of 1-29 seconds.

I needed a carousel which would refresh and switch beetween the tabs every x (users input) seconds so I came up with this idea.

The extension is meant to run locally as when synced with other computers might cause some mayhem.
